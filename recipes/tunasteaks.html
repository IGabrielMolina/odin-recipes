        There are two types of ahi tuna you can buy: bigeye tuna and yellowfin tuna. Bigeye tends to have a buttery taste, while yellowfin has a milder flavor. Both types of ahi tuna can be used for this recipe.

You should always buy sashimi-grade or sushi-grade tuna if you plan to eat it raw. This means the fish market has deemed it safe to eat raw.
